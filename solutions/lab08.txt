5)

We are asked to explain the expression 's/(.{4})/& /g;s/ $//'

This expression has two replace commands: 's/(.{4})/& /g' and 's/ $//'

For the first command, (.{4}) will match and capture as back references groups of 4 characters. The '& ' outputs the matched pattern and a space after it, and since everery line has 16 digits, then every line will have produce a line with groups of four characters followed by a space.

The command 's/ $//' simple removes the last space at the end of every line.

awk '{print NR " " $0}' longfile.txt
